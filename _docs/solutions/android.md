with some effort it is now possible to run WireMock 2.x on Android.
Please see

## Useful pages

- [WireMock and Kotlin](./kotlin.md) - Android ecosystem embraces Kotlin as a development language,
  and there are some additional tooling available
- [WireMock on Java and JVM](./jvm.md) - Some of JVM generic solutions are applicable to Android development too
